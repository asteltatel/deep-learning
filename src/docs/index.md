## Syllabus

This class covers deep learning from a theoretical basis to example
applications. We start with simple multi-layer perceptrons, backpropogation, and
gradient descent, exploring at the fundamental aspects of deep learning in
depth. We cover a wide range of deep learning topics, from Natural Language
Processing to Generative Adversarial Networks; the full schedule is below. The
goal is that students understand the capacities of deep learning, the current
state of the field, and the challenges of using and developing deep learning
algorithms. By the end of this class, we expect students that students will be
able to understand recent literature in deep learning, implement novel neural
network architectures, use and understand the PyTorch library in many ways, and
apply deep learning to different domains.
